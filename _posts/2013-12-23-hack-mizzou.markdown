I can't believe it's been nearly two months since Hack Mizzou 2013.  If you didn't know, this was the first time that the Association for Computing Machinery has ever hosted an event of this scale.  From the start, it was an experiment.  We didn't know if anyone would show up, let alone create mind-blowing apps.  We were amazed at the level of support we recieved from the sponsor companies and the University of Missouri.

* The sponsors donated an incredible total of $3,850
* We spent $2,684 total which includes everything from reserving the room to advertisements in the mass MU Info email.
* We raised $1,166 for the Association for Computing Machinery from 7 company sponsors
* [13 teams][projects] finished their apps and presented at the end of the day
* 103 resumes were sent to the sponsor companies
* Students travelled from Truman and Rolla to participate.
* The College of Engineering supported us [before][coe-tweet] and [after][coe-article] the event

### Broader App Categories
In the days before Hack Mizzou we realized that the categories were too specific.  Unfortunately, we couldn't change them since teams had already started planning apps for specific categories.  Next year, I'd like to see us adpot the ranking system used at [Hack the Midwest][hack-the-midwest] and [Compute Midwest][compute-midwest].  The categories were "Best In Show", "Most Entertaining" and "Most Technically Challenging" in addition to sponsor API prizes. Their categories allow participants to focus on creating an amazng app first, which can then fall into any category.

### Multi-day event
Like I said, this was an experiment to learn how to organize events. Now that we have some practice, I think we should take Hack Mizzou to the next level by making it a weekend long event.  More time will allow better apps to be built. Also, this will attract more developers from other schools since too many people declined since only one day of hacking wasn't worth the travel time.
